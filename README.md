# üöÄ GraphQL-Demo-Android: From REST to the Graph

A modern, practical demonstration of implementing **GraphQL** in an Android application using the **Apollo Kotlin Client**. This repository showcases how to build a high-performance, type-safe data layer within a fully modern Android stack, avoiding the pitfalls of traditional REST APIs.

## üìù Article: Why GraphQL is the Future for Android Performance

This demo is the companion project for my Medium article where I dive deep into the architectural advantages of GraphQL over REST, especially for complex mobile applications.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Modern Stack

This project is built using the latest Android tooling to ensure performance, maintainability, and code quality:

* **Modern MVVM & Clean Architecture:** Structured with strict separation of concerns using a **Clean Architecture** approach for testability and scalability.
* **Declarative UI with Jetpack Compose:** The entire user interface is implemented using **Jetpack Compose** for a modern, reactive, and efficient UI development experience.
* **Type-Safe Data Layer:** The **Apollo Kotlin Client** is used to generate Kotlin models directly from the GraphQL schema, providing **compile-time safety**.
* **Kotlin DSL:** The build configuration uses **Kotlin DSL** for Gradle, offering a type-safe and declarative way to manage dependencies.
* **Concurrency:** Leverages **Kotlin Coroutines & Flow** for handling all asynchronous network operations.
* **GraphQL Core:** Includes implementation of efficient **`Queries`** and **`Mutations`** to demonstrate full CRUD functionality.

## üíª Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Android Studio IDE (Latest Stable Version)
* JDK 17 or higher

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/satishnada/GraphQL-Demo-Android.git](https://github.com/satishnada/GraphQL-Demo-Android.git)
    ```

2.  **Open and Sync:**
    Open the cloned directory in Android Studio. Gradle will automatically sync, fetch dependencies, and run the essential Apollo code generation step.

3.  **Run the App:**
    Select your desired device or emulator and press the Run button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è).

### Schema & Queries Location

All GraphQL definition files (schema and queries) are located within the `src/main/graphql` directory, managed by the Apollo plugin.
